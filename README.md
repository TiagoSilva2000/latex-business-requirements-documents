This repository contains a sample Business Requirements Document for LaTeX, the free typesetting system .

## What is a Business Requirements Document ##

According to the [BABOK](http://www.iiba.org/babok-guide/babok-guide-v2/babok-guide-online/appendix-a-glossary.aspx):

"A Business Requirements Document is a requirements package that describes business requirements and stakeholder requirements (it documents requirements of interest to the business, rather than documenting business requirements)."

It helps the business analyst to capture the requirements from the various sources, prioritize and rank them.

## Why Latex? ## 

I have been working with LaTeX for more than a decade and really enjoy preparing structured documents with it. It follows a strict syntax and can be easily transformed into or from other formats.
